# Python CTypes tutorial.

This sample code is replicated here from [https://dbader.org/blog/python-ctypes-tutorial](https://dbader.org/blog/python-ctypes-tutorial).

## Steps

1. You can use either `CMake` or the `Makefile` for trying out the demo.
2. Simplest way is to run `make` on the terminal and it will build and run the example.

* Refer [this](https://github.com/jima80525/ctypes_example) GitHub repository
  for more details.
* The code will not match the example on the website as it has been modified to
  some extent to remove warning and other minor issues.
* In-case you have `Python2` and `Python3` observe the runtime behavior.
